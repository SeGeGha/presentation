## [Slide 1 - pic "good code vs bad code"] 
Programming principles describe how to write “good” code. But what is good code? 
Some believe that this is code that runs very quickly, others believe that it may be more design patterns. 
But the right answer lies on the surface.

## [Slide 2 - text "code=information"]
Code is information in its purest form. And the main criteria for the value of 
information are credibility, accessibility, understandability. 

## [Slide 3 - pic "monkey at the computer]
Why credibility and accessibility are important is obvious. Importance of the first and 
second values is obvious. If the code works with errors or if our server with the application is not available. 
There is no point in code that works with errors or in an application whose server is not available. 
Let's try to understand why code understandability is important.

## [Slide 4 - text "understandability is cool"]
In a such code, it’s easier to look for errors, it’s easier to change, modify and support. 
So, understandability is a core value that a programmer should strive for. However, there is one problem. 
Understandability is a subjective thing and we need a more objective criterion for this. And that is simplicity. 
Actually, a simple application is more understandable than complex. However, simplicity is difficult to achieve.

## [Slide 5 - text "simplicity => KISS"]
The theme of simplicity touches on the principle of KISS (acronym for «Keep it simple, stupid»). 
This is a very general and abstract design principle used in programming, which contains almost all other principles. 
You can find variations on this phrase: «Keep it Simple, Silly», «keep it short and simple», «keep it simple and straightforward» and
«keep it small and simple»but in general they mean a same thing.

## [Slide 6 - bio "Clarence Johnson"]
This phrase is associated with aircraft designer Clarence Johnson and 

## [Slide 7 - pic "Plane"]
it’s best illustrated by the story when Johnson handed a team of design engineers several tools, challenging 
them that the jet plane they designed should be repairable for the average mechanic in the field in combat only these tools. 
Thus, “stupid” refers to a relationship between a fact that everything breaks down and a complexity of the repair necessary for this.

## [Slide 8 - text with pic "man on a horse"] 
In this principle, main focus is on an idea that if we cannot understand our product, 
we cannot use it correctly. You should leave after yourself, perhaps, not a most creative, but reliable and understandable code 
for other programmers.

## [Slide 9-10 - text with quotes] 
The KISS Principle is associated with many other well-known quotes, phrases, and principles. Of them:
- Occam's razor «Entities should not be multiplied without necessity».
- Leonardo da Vinci «Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication».
- Ludwig Mies van der Rohe - «Less is More».
- Bjarn Stroustrup «Make simple tasks simple!».

## [Slide 11 - text "Kiss in programming"] 
In the programmed principle, KISS can be described as follows:
- no sense to limit a level of abstraction indefinitely, you need to be able to stop in time;
- no sense to lay in your project unnecessary functions which may in the future and be useful to someone, or may not be 
(this is more likely to be a more correct approach according to the YAGNI principle) - all possible requirements from the project 
in the future cannot be predicted;
- you should not connect a huge library if you only need a couple of functions from it;

## [Slide 12 - text "Kiss in programming"] 
- decomposition of complex things into simple components is an architecturally correct approach 
(here KISS has something in common with DRY «Don’t repeat yourself»);
- absolute mathematical accuracy or extreme detail is not always needed - most systems are not designed to launch spacecraft, 
data can and should be processed with the accuracy that is sufficient for a high-quality solution to the problem.

## [Slide 13 - text "your strategy"] 
To apply the KISS principle (and not only it) in your practice, it is worthwhile to take a meaningful approach to the analysis 
of the task. First of all, visualize the task. Make it a minimally working implementation, evaluate the potential of your 
implementation for further development. Then stabilize it for specific requirements and do optimization.

## [Slide 14 - pic "professional programmer"] 
Quote so, there are specialists who can immediately write “clean”, working applications. But it’s hardly possible for most developers, 
especially beginners. So, do not underestimate power of a philosophical part of programming, and in particular, principles of 
programming.
